    "lyrics": "A sword of fire and an axe of coal\n Vision of the sibyl has foretold\n Armies gather on the battle-plain\n All will fall and Earth will die in flames\n Here on the Battle-Plain\n We will die in flames\n In Falcon's feathers soaring overhead\n Choosing warriors among the dead\n Twilight written in the runes of crones\n Freya weeps upon her golden throne\n Upon her golden throne\n We wait for her alone\n Call us unto your hall\n Take us into your thrall\n The battle rages, but they fight in vain\n When all is done it must begin again\n",
