    "description": "Sonic Prayer, Earthless' debut album, was released on April 26, 2005 by Gravity Records. It was recorded at Gravity Studios with producer Matt A. and mixed at Strange Sounds by Gars Wood. \"Flower Travelin' Man\" was named in homage to the Japanese psychedelic rock group Flower Travellin' Band, and \"Lost in the Cold Sun\" as a reference to Cold Sun, an obscure psychedelic rock group from Texas. The band would have made the songs longer than their ultimate length of about twenty minutes but could not because the album was recorded on analog tape; drummer Mario Rubalcaba explained that the tape was not long enough to hold more material than that. Allmusic reviewer Thom Jurek remarked that \"Droning, thudding space jams are Earthless' trip du jour, and they do it shockingly well.\" He praised Isaiah Mitchell's \"stellar\" guitar playing, Mario Rubalcaba's \"beat-heavy atmospherics\", and Mike Eginton's \"repetitive, hypnotic\" bass lines while noting the Black Sabbath influences in \"Lost in the Cold Sun\" and calling the album one of the best in the stoner rock genre. The record received the award for Best Hard Rock Album at the 2007 San Diego Music Awards.",

    "name": "Rythms from a Cosmic Sky",
    "description": "Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, their second studio album, was released on May 8, 2007 by Tee Pee Records, their first album for the label. It consists of two instrumental pieces, with the first track \"Godspeed\" divided into five suites. The album was recorded and mixed from January 1â€“4, 2007, at Louder Studios in San Francisco with producer Tim Green and mastered by Dave Gardner at Magneto Mastering in Minneapolis. The CD version also includes a cover version of the Groundhogs' \"Cherry Red\", which is one of the few songs recorded by Earthless to feature lyrics and vocals; Mitchell sings lead vocals on the track. The recording process for Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky was rather spontaneous and, because the album was recorded on analog tape (as was Sonic Prayer), the songs were limited to being approximately 20 minutes in length. Rubalcaba later reflected that the band were not able to fully express themselves on this album because of the length restrictions and how often they improvised during recording; he said that not all of what the band were inspired to do could be recorded owing to these limitations. Critical reaction to the album was mostly positive. Thom Jurek of Allmusic praised Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, describing the band as \"belong[ing] more with the Japanese bands\" such as The Stars or Acid Mothers Temple but making favorable comparisons to such acts as Jimi Hendrix, Cream and Humble Pie. He concluded that the band are \"a whole other thing in American power rock right now. They point a way that few will be able to follow.\" Keith Carman, reviewing for Exclaim!, noted that only those with the patience for long songs or those in \"altered states of consciousness\" could tolerate the album, but described it as \"quite the interesting celestial ride\". Giving the album a 7 out of 10, PopMatters' Mark W. Adams complimented both the band's long instrumental material and the cover of \"Cherry Red\", saying the latter demonstrated that they also do well with shorter material. Stylus Magazine stated that \"Godspeed\" and \"Sonic Prayer\" suffered from redundancy, as reviewer Charles Robbins said that the group cease to develop the two songs beyond a certain point, but praised the cover of \"Cherry Red\" and gave the album a B-. The album was nominated for Best Hard Rock Album at the 2007 San Diego Music Awards, at which the band themselves were nominated as Best Hard Rock Artist. In 2009, the A.V. Club named it one of the best metal albums of that decade, describing the material as \"something close to the Platonic ideal of heavy rock\".",
